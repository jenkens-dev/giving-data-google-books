npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This app interacts with the Google Books API and in order to run it locally you will be an API key or OAuth 2.0 token. Check out the [Google Books API documentation](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#APIKey) for more information.

## Features

- [x] The home page should display a search bar that allows the user to search for books that match a keyword.
- [x] Searching for a term should query the Google Books API to display a list of books that match the term.
- [x] The home page should display the collection of books that match the search results.
- [x] Clicking a book on the home page should open a more detailed view of the selected book.

### Future Iterations

- [ ] Pagination
